      Follow the guidelines. It will take longer to fix your issue if you don't.

      *Golden rules:*
      1. Search for [open](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) and
         [closed](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
         before submitting your own.
      2. Make sure you are using a
         [supported Godot version](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/about/release_policy.html).
      3. One issue for one bug.
      4. Write a descriptive title.
      5. Confirm the bug with a minimal reproductive project (MRP). (see below)

      We need to identify if the bug was recently introduced in the engine, or
      if it was always present.
      - Copy and paste the version by clicking the version shown in the editor
        (bottom bar) or in the project manager (top bar).

        in our [download archive](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/).

      Describe your issue briefly.

      You can include images or videos with drag and drop, and format code
      blocks or logs with <code>```</code> tags, on separate lines before and
      after the text. (Use <code>```gdscript</code> to add GDScript syntax
      highlighting.)

      >  Please do **not** add code examples or error messages as screenshots

    label: Steps to reproduce
    description: |
      List of steps or sample code that reproduces the issue. Contributors need
      to reproduce issues in order to fix them.

    label: Minimal reproduction project (MRP)
    description: |
      Contributors will use the MRP to validate that the fix is working as
      intended.
      - Drag and drop a ZIP archive containing a small Godot project which
        reproduces the issue to upload it (max 10Â MB). **Do not select another
        field until the project is done uploading.**
      - Make sure that the project contains the minimal amount of assets or
        code.
      - Be sure to not include the `.godot` folder in the archive (but keep
        `project.godot`).
      - We encourage the use of GDScript.
      - Detail how to use your MRP if needed.

      ---

      If you are **absolutely sure** that the reproduction steps are not
      project-dependent (the bug can be also seen in a brand new project), you
      can write "N/A" in the field.
